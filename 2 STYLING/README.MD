What you could use, recommended by me?

- **IF** Simple small app : Pure CSS, SASS with class changing or style prop for dynamic styles \*
- **IF** Bigger app, bigger team which doesn't love modern CSS in JS solution: CSS Modules, classnames composition for dynamic styles or style prop \*
- **IF** Everybody comfortable with Javascript and using only react or react native: styled-components.
- **IF** Framework agnostic solution: CSS modules \* or Emotion

Where are also others like: [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [stylable](https://stylable.io/).

\* NOT REUSABLE WITH REACT NATIVE
